# Particle Party

Nbody / physics simulation built with Bevy, Heron, and WASM

Inspired by these two projects:
- https://github.com/pjankiewicz/nbody
- https://github.com/hunar4321/particle-life

## Notes

The desktop version has HDR/bloom enabled, but as far as I can tell, this isn't working for WASM builds yet
